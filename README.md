# OpenData Community Resources

The files in this repository are intended to be a growing descriptive list of projects, communities, terms, tips for Hackathon participants, and other open source resources for anyone interested in fighting Sybils while resisting data recentralization.  

## As we update files in these directories, the website itself will be updated as well:
- Docs
- Blog
