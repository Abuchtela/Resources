### What is the ODC?

The OpenData Community is a new initiative originally founded by Gitcoin. Through activities like hackathons, knowledge curation, and others, we hope to create, capture and distribute value to those building decentralization solutions for an Open Data Layer for web3

### Our mission
Our mission is two-fold:
- Protect web3 via data science for good 
- Resist centralization at the data layer

### Active Projects
1. Bootstrapping the ODC Community [join us on discord](https://discord.gg/8zMHkgscrf)
2. Supporting efforts of our builders including Mirall0x and other Sandbox project
3. Building our governance in public - including the use of the Hats Protocol
<br />

## Our Focus
- Sybil Resistance
- Decentralized Data Infrastructure & Applications
<br />

### Why Does it Matter?
- Sybil resistance is the fight against fake accounts.  If we collectively do not resist Sybil attacks, one of the real bright spots of web3 - the collective funding of public goods - could be captured by criminal forces.  
- Decentralized Data Infrastructure & Applications are essential for combating the recentralization of data.  If we continue to take short cuts when accessing and analyzing blockchain data, we are adding vulnerability to the ecosystem right above the decentralized blockchains.
