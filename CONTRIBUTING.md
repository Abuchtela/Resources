# Welcome to the ODC contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to the OpenData Community!  We are excited to build an Open Data Layer for Web3 with you and all of our partners!. 

## How we Coordinate
- We have created working groups that you can get involved in. Please refer to our discord for more info

- We are using [discord](https://discord.gg/havA38Xa7q) for the community and general coordination.

- We are testing out [Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/opendata-community.) for task management

- And we are using [this Github repo](https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3/Resources) for contributions and building in public.

- You can find our calendar of meetings and events [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=698a35b1c1a24bdae78f30cbe3fc081c5fbb681c748a45df61040c6e6f26c932@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles)

# Contribute With Ease

Here is the flow if you are **NOT** a member of the ODC Organization on Github

- Sign in to your [Github Account](https://github.com/)
- Go to the [ODC Resources Repo](https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3/Resources)


## Solving Issues

1. The easiest way to start contributing is to check out our [Github Issues](https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3/Resources/issues)

2. Scan through them to find one that suits you. 

3. Click on the file requiring editing or Create a new file if the task requires it. 

4. You can edit existing files by pressing on the crayon icon on the right side of the page

5. When you are done working on the file, click PROPOSE CHANGE at the bottom of the file. This will automatically create a new fork and branch.

6. You will then need to create a Pull Request (follow the prompt)

7. If there is a open issue associated with your PR, add the issue # into either the summary or description field as `#<number>`, e.g. the issue number is 32, so add `#32`.  

8. Make sure to keep the checkmark that says "allow edits by maintainers" checked (this allows us to edit your proposed change)

9. PR's need to be reviewed by at least 1 other member of the ODC before merging. 

10. You can post the link to your PR request in our discord for review

11. Once you submit your PR, a ODC member will review your work. We may ask questions, comment, edit

12. Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible in the repository.  

**Congratulations & Thank You! You have contributed to the ODC Community**

<br />

> If you **ARE** a member of the ODC Organization on Github

  - The only difference is when you create your PR, you can assign a reviewer directly and do not need to post the PR link in discord to attract the attention of a reviewer
<br />

# Alternative Method for Contributing

- If you are new to github, we suggest using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), an IDE for editing file. [Getting started with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) will guide you through setting up VSC. 

- If you are a seasoned github user, feel free to use the applications you are comfortable with and follow the guidelines below.


## Creating Pull Requests and Standard Operating Procedures

1. The first step is to clone [ODC Resources](https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3/Resources)

2. For new github users, we suggest following the promps in Visual code, for seasoned users you can use whatever you like. 

3. Find the file you want to make changes to or create a new file if that is what the task requires.

4. Create a new branch to work on. We suggest using a branch name similar to `<user>-<patch><#>`, e.g. sarob-patch01.

5. Create a fix and when it is ready submit a PR to the original Repo

6. PR's need to be reviewed by at least 1 other member of the ODC before merging. Please assign a reviewer in your PR and label it accordingly.

7. The description field in the PR is optional. 

8. If there is an issue associated with your PR, add the issue # into either the summary or description field as `#<number>`, e.g. the issue number is 32, so add `#32`.  

9. Once you submit your PR, a ODC member will review your work. We may ask questions or request additional information.

10. Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible in the repository.
