ODC will permanently publish the records of the Jan 2023 Hackathon and the resulting submissions and bounty winners via the [ODCDataforWeb3/Jan2023hackathon repository](https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3/Jan2023hackathon) 

README in the repository explains the history of the hackathon, an overview of the bounties, and the results. 

**Update https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/DataBuilders/? Gitcoin Databuilders Hackathon page with the same content as the README and links back to the ODC Jan2023 Hackathon repository.**

**We need to collaborate with Gitcoin FDD on above changes to the Gitcoin DataBuilders hackathon page.**

Update the OpenDataCommunity.org hackathon menu to link to a local page that highlights the latest hackathon with a link to the ODC Jan2023 Hackathon repository, future event / hackathon plans, and past hackathons. 

## Reach out to a few people and sponsors that can help the ODC immediately

- @Poupou will lead the discussions around projects and names together with @stef-says. See https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3/sandbox/wiki/1st-workgroup-meeting---17st-Feb

## Help the contributors with next steps, Providing ODC Sandbox, tools, and mentoring

- We provide ODC mentoring to help new members on how to operate a project. The ODC Jedi are the mentors to start.
- We provide the ODC Sandbox github organization https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3-sandbox 
- The https://github.com/OpenDataforWeb3/sandbox is location of all the how to create and maintain an ODC sandbox project documentation and the index to all the sandbox projects
- We provide easy instructions on how to create a repository within the ODC Sandbox github organization for their work and team. Two good options:
  - Make the project leader a member of the github organization and have them follow https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo OR
  - Ask the project leader to push a PR "Create a Sandbox Repository for my XYZ Project" to the OpenDataforWeb3/Sandbox repository and we automate the creation of the repository.
- We provide access to tools:
  - Comms: Discord
  - Project: Github Projects (we setup a project and a training session on using with issues)
  - Wiki: Github wiki (we setup a basic pages)
  - Repository: Github
  - IDE: Visual Studio Code, Github online, and HackMD (we help the project get setup and a training session on pushing PRs)
  - CICD: Github Actions (TBD what we can support)
  - OpenData stack: Operating stack to be used by the ODC members in the analysis and support of sandbox projects. Likely from the [landscape](../../docs/landscape.md) options. Partners and / or sponsors may contribute licensing and pricing options. (TBD what we can support) **A good place to develop strategy on this will be at ETHDenver. Let's revisit this after.**
