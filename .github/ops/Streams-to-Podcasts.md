# Overview

The twitter spaces recordings are available for 30 days via twitter so we need a way to make them available for longer. 

I took the time to run a podcast last year for a startup, so I have some recent experience of what we can do to make these recordings available longer and probably increase their reach. 

This effort can be split into three parts that three different teams or people can take responsibility for. 

1. Interview
1. Sound / Video engineering
1. Publishing

# Interview

I would start by interviewing a person using a aftermarket microphone (and a decent video camera if this is more than audio). The resulting sound (and video) needs to be long term stored so anymore on the teams can access them. Gdrive seems like the place to start due to cost and easy access from team members. Store as **DDMMYYY-interviewed-topic.extension.**

Using macOS iMovie, a one hour source file can be turned around as a cast in about 1-4 hours depending on the original sound quality and if you need to edit out sections of content 

I created an header and footer jingle using the iPhone application Medly. Any music making app will do. I reviewed a few popular podcasts intro and exit music and then spent about an hour fiddling with the app. A few reviews with a small audience and done. 

I created the first cast similar to above using the name format of "56: Mark Collier, Mobile Innovation Eats the Wires". Modified it until it looked and sounded like I expected. Then I created a duplicate of it with a generic title like "XX: template".

The final step is selecting File, Share, File. For audio choose MP3 format. For video choose 540p, high quality, better quality compression. If you are saving video, make sure to save the audio separately. Drop the file(s) into Gdrive alongside the source file. 

# Publishing 

Publish back to Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube, Facebook and SimpleCast (Spotify, Apple, and Overcast). Simplecast costs $15/month for a 2 person license to push casts to multiple platforms. 

Sean can add a bit more here about how to use simplecast, YouTube, and Facebook. The rest are pretty easy from memory.
