README in the repository explains the history of the hackathon, an overview of the bounties, and the results. 

**Update https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/DataBuilders/? Gitcoin Databuilders Hackathon page with the same content as the README and links back to the ODC Jan2023 Hackathon repository.**

**We need to collaborate with Gitcoin FDD on above changes to the Gitcoin DataBuilders hackathon page.**

Update the OpenDataCommunity.org hackathon menu to link to a local page that highlights the latest hackathon with a link to the ODC Jan2023 Hackathon repository, future event / hackathon plans, and past hackathons.
